#Homework Two: Regexes in Python 

See the homework assignment <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall15/CSCI-UA.0480-006/homework2.html">here</a>.

The object is to create two programs using regular expressions that identify (1) dollar amounts and (2) telephone numbers in a corpus.

Note -- still needs tweaking :)

#Run

To run this file, replace `input.txt` with any text file of your choosing.

For a return of dollar instances, run `dollars.py` and see the output in `dollarsOutput.txt `

For a return of telephone number instances, run `phone-numbers.py` and see the output in `telephoneOutput.txt`
